## Description

This application is my portfolio using React. My updated site contains:

- An About page where I introduce myself.

- A Project page with cards of my projects. For each project, I include the following:

  - Project title

  - Description

  - Link to the deployed version

  - Link to the GitHub repository

  - GIF or screenshot of the deployed application

- A Skill page where I showcase the skills I have gained during the Coding Program.

- A Contact page with links to my GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as my email address and phone number.

- A Resume page with a link to a PDF of my resume.

If you resize the screen you will view my **Mobile-first design**. Navbar hides when screen size is reduced and will display navbar when collapse button is clicked.
